# vBUSdevkit
A dev kit that helps with creating userscripts for vBulletin forum software

## Intro
I created this for the website http://unknowncheats.me/ to give better support for userscript development. Therefore I haven't tested it on newer versions of vBullitin. If you do encouter problems with newer versions of vBullitin, leave an issue and I'll have a look.
